# Creating a Scrum dashboard

In this entry, you can read my process to create a scrum dashboard. I'm going to explain the tools, epics, user stories, tasks and other decisions I made for this phase.

## Scrum and choosing the right tool
It's not a secret that Scrum is a widely use agile framework for most software development projects. Scrum have its strenghts and weaknesses. As a Developer, you always need to find the right tool for the tasks in hand, not choose it because the tool is in vogue. As a solo dev is a bit different, I have scarce resources than a team of +3 devs, so my tool election need to be limited to what I already know or the knowledge curve for the new tool (it has to be short).  
Personally, I consider Scrum as a *large* framework, therefor **overkilling** for a solo dev, but one thing that I find pretty usefull for documenting and planning porpouses is the Scrum dashboard, it's a fit tool for the task in hand, so let me start with the process.
