# Experience app

This repo is to document a mobile application for a company called VB Tours. It works as a center point for all the needed docs and code.

In the Blog directory, you can read the entire process, from creation to deployment.

The code and docs will be in their respective directories. Some technologies in consideration are:

 - AWS Lambda Functions with Rust custom runtime

 - AWS DynamoDB

 - React Native (for now with JS, maybe TS in the near future)

 - ReactJS, if a web version is required

 - Figma for wireframes and mocks

There will be times where there is no documentation or it is combined with code.
